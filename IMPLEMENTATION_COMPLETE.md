```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_feature_system
```

### Step 2: Seed Database
```bash
# Production
SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD="your-secure-password" npm run seed

# Development with demo data
SEED_DEMO_DATA=true SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD="password" npm run seed
```

### Step 3: Test It Out

**As Tenant Owner:**
1. Login to demo tenant
2. Go to `/settings/features`
3. Enable/disable features
4. See features grouped by category
5. Try "Reset to Defaults"

**As Super Admin:**
1. Login as super admin
2. Go to `/super-admin/business-types`
3. View all 9 business type templates
4. See template details and feature counts

## ðŸ’¡ Usage Examples

### Check Feature in Component
```tsx
import { useFeature } from '@/hooks/use-features'

export function MyComponent() {
  const hasTables = useFeature('enable_table_management')

  if (!hasTables) return null

  return <TablesView />
}
```

### Conditional Rendering
```tsx
import { FeatureGate } from '@/components/feature-gate'

<FeatureGate feature="enable_table_reservations">
  <ReservationButton />
</FeatureGate>
```

### Protect API Routes
```tsx
import { isFeatureEnabled } from '@/lib/features'

export async function GET(request) {
  const hasFeature = await isFeatureEnabled(tenantId, 'enable_online_ordering')
  if (!hasFeature) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Feature not enabled' }, { status: 403 })
  }
  // ... continue
}
```
