## 🗄️ Database Information

### Pre-seeded Data
The database comes with:
- ✅ 1 Demo Tenant (Coffee Shop)
- ✅ 2 Users (Admin & Cashier)
- ✅ 3 Categories (Beverages, Food, Desserts)
- ✅ 8 Products with stock
- ✅ 6 Tables
- ✅ 3 Sample Customers
- ✅ 1 Discount Code (SUMMER10)

### Reseed Database (if needed)
```bash
npm run prisma:push
npm run prisma:seed
```

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Features Not Yet Implemented:
1. **Product CRUD Operations**: UI exists, but backend API endpoints for create/update/delete need completion
2. **Customer CRUD**: Similar to products
3. **Receipt Printing**: Hardware integration exists but needs thermal printer
4. **Kitchen Display**: Feature flag exists but UI not implemented
5. **Shift Management**: Database schema exists but no UI
6. **Discount Application**: Code exists in seed but not integrated in POS
7. **Image Upload**: Product images supported but no upload UI
8. **Email Notifications**: Resend integration exists but not wired up

### API Routes Status:
- ✅ **Working**: `/api/products` (GET), `/api/orders` (GET, POST), `/api/customers` (GET), `/api/tables` (GET), `/api/settings` (GET), `/api/reports` (GET)
- ⚠️ **Partially Implemented**: Product/Customer create/update/delete endpoints
- ❌ **Not Implemented**: Payment processing, Email sending, Receipt printing

## 🔑 Key Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. Session Management
**File**: `src/components/providers.tsx`
```tsx
// Added SessionProvider wrapper
<SessionProvider>{children}</SessionProvider>
```

### 2. Login Redirect
**File**: `src/app/login/page.tsx`
```tsx
// Changed from router.push to window.location.href
window.location.href = "/dashboard"
```

### 3. Tenant Resolution
**File**: `src/lib/tenant.ts`
```tsx
// Default to 'demo' tenant on localhost
if (!subdomain && host.includes('localhost')) {
  subdomain = 'demo'
}
```

### 4. Logout Functionality
**File**: `src/components/logout-button.tsx`
```tsx
// Proper NextAuth signOut
await signOut({ callbackUrl: "/login" })
```
